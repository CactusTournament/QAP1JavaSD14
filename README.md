# 📚 Java Assessment – QAP

A short assessment completed as part of the Software Development program.

---

## ⏱ How many hours did it take to complete this assessment?

It took me approximately 2 hours to complete Problem 1 as I was still getting familiar with Java. Problems 2 and 3 were more straightforward, taking about 1–2 hours each. Total time: ~5–6 hours.

---

## 🌐 What online resources have you used?

My previous programs and notes were my main references. I also consulted MDN documentation when needed, which provided the extra clarity required for Java syntax.

---

## 🙋‍♂️ Did you ask any of your friends in solving the problems?

I did not ask friends for help. This assessment was a good opportunity to practice Java independently.

---

## ❓ Did you need to ask questions to any of your instructors?

I considered attending a TA session due to some initial folder setup issues, but I resolved them quickly by reviewing my notes and continued without further help.

---

## 📊 Rate subjectively the difficulty of each question from your own perspective, and whether you feel confident that you can solve a similar but different problem requiring some of the same techniques in the future now that you've completed this one.

- Problem 1: 3/5  
- Problem 2: 2/5  
- Problem 3: 2/5  

Overall, I feel confident that the conventions and techniques learned in this assessment will help me tackle similar problems in the future. This QAP was a great introduction to the world of Java!
